# Blockchain on Rails

My visual representation of a blockchain - in the rails format.

If you're not sure what a blockchain is, it is way to decentralize transactions.

Blockchains are a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.

Quite simply, each transaction holds the details of the previous transaction, creating a chain of data(or 'Blocks') - hence the name blockchain.



Here is a quick preview of what I have running, but if you want to mess around a little more, you can check out the project live on Heroku.
